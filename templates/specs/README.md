# Specs/ directory: Specifications, Implementation Plans, and Bug fixes workflow

### Todo directory
The specs/todo directory contains specs or plans for new features and/or bug fixes.
- files in this directory represent raw ideas that might need to be done in the future, but have not been spec'd, planned or implemented yet.
- see specs/todo/README.md for an index of all the todo items in the folder


### Spec and Bug index
These files represent completed specifications in the specs/ directory.  This list should be updated when the specs are completed.
<!-- Add spec entries here as they are created and implemented -->
