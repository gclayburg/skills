check build should have an option --follow that will follow the build if it is already in progress instead of just exiting.
pushmon should be able to infer the job name like checkbuild.sh does

pushmon should report the status of all stages, not just ones that it started to discover
if you push to phandledemo-IT the first few stages run quickly.  They still need to be reported.
