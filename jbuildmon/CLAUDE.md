## Testing
- IMPORTANT: jbuildmon uses bats-core version located at ./test/bats/bin/bats, do not use any bats command in your $PATH.

## Hints
- See [hints/index.md](hints/index.md) for hard-won lessons from debugging and development. Check these before investigating test failures or platform-specific issues.
