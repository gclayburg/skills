description: Jenkins CI/CD build pipeline monitor. Check build status, push and monitor builds, follow builds in real-time, and analyze build timing, executor capacity, pipeline structure, and queue contention. Use when the user asks about CI/CD status, build results, wants to push code and monitor the Jenkins build, asks if CI is passing, or needs help optimizing Jenkins throughput. Triggers include "check build", "build status", "is CI passing", "is the build green", "push and watch", "push and monitor", "what failed in CI", "why did the build fail", "follow the build", "watch the build", "trigger a build", "run the build", "why is Jenkins slow", "which agents are busy", "what is in the queue", "show pipeline structure", and "find the bottleneck".

# buildgit

A CLI for git operations and monitoring Jenkins CI/CD build pipelines.

## What this skill does

- replacement for `git push` command.  Instead of `git push` use `buildgit push`
- uses git to push changes then expects a Jenkins build to automatically start, then monitors it
- shows Jenkins build status in many different ways
- analyzes build timing, executor capacity, pipeline structure, and queue contention to enable build optimization
- uses Jenkins REST api to monitor and track a Jenkins pipeline build job
- any command unknown to `buildgit` is delegated to `git`, e.g. `buildgit log` would run `git log`

All paths in this document are relative to this SKILL.md file's directory, not the project root.

## How to use

```
what is the build status
```

```
push the staged changes and monitor the build.  fix any errors you find.
```

Default one-line format (`status --line`, `push --line`, `build --line`) is:
`%s #%n id=%c Tests=%t Took %d on %I (%r)`

Default threads format (`--threads` on TTY monitoring) is:
`  [%-14a] %S %g %p %e / %E`

Threads placeholders are separate from `--format` placeholders:
`%a`=agent `%S`=stage `%g`=progress-bar `%p`=percent `%e`=elapsed `%E`=estimate `%%`=literal%
Use width/alignment like `%14a` or `%-14a`. `BUILDGIT_THREADS_FORMAT` sets the default when `--threads` has no explicit format argument.

## Interpreting Output

**Exit codes:**

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success (build passed, or git command succeeded) |
| 1 | Build failed, or an error occurred |
| 2 | Build is currently in progress |

**Build states:**  as reported by Jenkins
- `SUCCESS` — build passed, all tests green
- `FAILURE` — build failed; output includes failed stage and error details
- `BUILDING` — build is still running
- `ABORTED` — build was manually cancelled
- `UNSTABLE` — build completed with test failures or marked warnings (common for flaky tests)
- `NOT_BUILT` — build was skipped or not executed (e.g., due to upstream failure or explicit skip)
- `UNKNOWN` — the state could not be determined (e.g., API error, incomplete data)
- `QUEUED` — build is waiting in the Jenkins queue and hasn't started running yet
- `Tests=!err!` in line output means Jenkins test-report data could not be retrieved due to a communication failure (network/sandbox/API connectivity), not a test result.

For failures, summarize the failed stage name, error logs, and test failure details for the user.
When a failure needs more detail, prefer `scripts/buildgit -v status --json` for structured failed-test stdout and `scripts/buildgit status --console-text <stage>` after `scripts/buildgit status --list-stages`.
`--console-text <stage>` accepts exact, case-insensitive, and unique partial stage matches. If the requested parent stage has no direct log text, it walks descendant substages and emits their logs in pipeline order.

For snapshot mode defaults, `scripts/buildgit status` prints one-line output by default on both TTY and non-TTY stdout (TTY adds color).
- Monitoring commands (`push`, `build`, `status -f`) print prior-jobs + estimated build time before monitoring starts
- Parallel branches with local `stages {}` blocks print as `Branch->Substage` rows under the branch, reuse the branch `║` marker and agent, expose `parallel_path` plus `parent_branch_stage` in `--json`, and `--threads` now shows the active `Branch->Substage` row live while follow-mode monitoring is running.

Build reference rules:
- `0` and `-0` mean latest/current build
- Negative values (`-1`, `-2`) are relative offsets from latest build
- Build reference and `-n` are mutually exclusive

**Console log (`--console`):**
On failed builds, buildgit shows a curated error summary by default.
- `--console auto` — force the default error log display even when test failures are present
- `--console N` — show last N raw console lines instead of curated summary (useful for troubleshooting)

For agent-safe follow mode, prefer:
- `scripts/buildgit status -f --once` to follow exactly one build and exit

## Build Optimization

Use this workflow when the user wants to reduce build time or understand Jenkins contention:

1. Run `scripts/buildgit queue` to see whether builds are waiting on capacity or blocked by quiet periods.
2. Run `scripts/buildgit agents` to identify which executor labels are saturated or offline, then `scripts/buildgit agents --nodes` to see which physical nodes overlap those labels.
3. Run `scripts/buildgit timing --tests` on a recent successful build to find slow stages, parallel bottlenecks, and expensive test suites.
4. Run `scripts/buildgit timing --tests --by-stage` to map those suites back to the stages that published them, or `scripts/buildgit timing --compare <a> <b>` / `scripts/buildgit timing -n <N>` to measure whether a rebalance actually helped.
5. Run `scripts/buildgit pipeline` to understand stage ordering, parallel branches, agent-label placement, and per-stage test suite summaries, then use [references/build-optimization.md](references/build-optimization.md) for the full workflow and constraints.

## Dynamic Context

To inject live build state into context before reasoning about build issues:

```
`scripts/buildgit status --json 2>/dev/null`
```
