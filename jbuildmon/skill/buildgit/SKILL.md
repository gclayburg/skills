description:
  Jenkins CI/CD build monitor. Check build status, push and monitor builds,
  follow builds in real-time. Use when the user asks about CI/CD status,
  build results, wants to push code and monitor the Jenkins build, or asks
  if CI is passing. Triggers: "check build", "build status", "is CI passing",
  "is the build green", "push and watch", "push and monitor", "what failed in CI",
  "why did the build fail", "follow the build", "watch the build", "trigger a build",
  "run the build".

# buildgit

A unified CLI for git operations with Jenkins CI/CD integration.

## Prerequisites

Before running any command, verify:
1. Jenkins env vars are set: `JENKINS_URL`, `JENKINS_USER_ID`, `JENKINS_API_TOKEN`
2. Project has `JOB_NAME=<name>` in its CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md

If any prerequisite is missing, tell the user what's needed instead of attempting the command.

The `buildgit` script is bundled at `scripts/buildgit` within this skill package.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `scripts/buildgit status` | Jenkins build status snapshot |
| `scripts/buildgit status -f` | Follow builds in real-time (Ctrl+C to stop) |
| `scripts/buildgit status --json` | Machine-readable Jenkins build status |
| `scripts/buildgit push` | Push + monitor Jenkins build until complete |
| `scripts/buildgit push --no-follow` | Push only, no build monitoring |
| `scripts/buildgit build` | Trigger a new build + monitor until complete |
| `scripts/buildgit build --no-follow` | Trigger only, no monitoring |
| `scripts/buildgit --job <name> <cmd>` | Override auto-detected job name |

## Interpreting Output

**Exit codes:**

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success (build passed, or git command succeeded) |
| 1 | Build failed, or an error occurred |
| 2 | Build is currently in progress |

**Build states:**
- `SUCCESS` — build passed, all tests green
- `FAILURE` — build failed; output includes failed stage and error details
- `BUILDING` — build is still running
- `ABORTED` — build was manually cancelled

For failures, summarize the failed stage name, error logs, and test failure details for the user.

## Dynamic Context

To inject live build state into context before reasoning about build issues:

```
!`scripts/buildgit status --json 2>/dev/null`
```
