We need to unify how buildgit shows a build in progress.  There are 2 ways this tool can show a build in progress.  One is through 'buildgit status -f'.  
The other is 'buildgit push'

I want to change this so that the output of these commands looks roughly the same and it gives us the infomration we need when a build is in progress.

not enough info:

```bash
$ echo "#" >> nonsensebuildtrigger.md && ./jbuildmon/buildgit add nonsensebuildtrigger.md && ./jbuildmon/buildgit commit -m 'test123' && ./jbuildmon/buildgit push
[main b372452] test123
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

```

buildgit status -f output:

```bash

$ ./jbuildmon/buildgit status -f

The part that 'buildgit status -f' gets correct is that it shows all the stages that have already been completed.  The buildgit push does not.
Note, in the output above, both commands were executed at about the same tiem, showing the same build.

Here is what I would like to see, starting at the opint where it finds that Job : ralph1 is found

```bash
╔════════════════════════════════════════╗
║          BUILD IN PROGRESS             ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════╝

Job:        ralph1

==================

[14:21:02] ℹ   Stage: Declarative: Checkout SCM (<1s)
[14:21:02] ℹ   Stage: Declarative: Agent Setup (<1s)
[14:21:02] ℹ   Stage: Initialize Submodules (10s)
[14:21:02] ℹ   Stage: Build (<1s)

```
At this point , the Stage: output lines would wait for the next stage to complete before printing the line corresponding to that stage.  This would continue until the build is complete.

Once the build has finished, then it should show the relevant output if something has failed or has become unstable. 
If the build was successful, then it should show the regular output that it shows now.
