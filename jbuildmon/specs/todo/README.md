# Todo: Pending Specs and Plans

Items in this directory represent features, enhancements, or bug fixes that have not been implemented yet. When an item is completed, move its file to `specs/` and add it to the Spec and Bug index in `specs/README.md`.

## Index

- **needed_tools.md** — New `buildgit` subcommands (`console`, `tests`, `status <build#>`) identified during debugging of build failures. Prioritized by usefulness during incident triage.
- **features-to-ralph.md** — Future feature ideas: `buildgit log` with per-commit build status, and a `--debug`/`-vv` verbose level for connection diagnostics.
