 when to expand the use of the in progress status bar, so it doesn't just apply to – – line space – F but also applies to any kind of bill status. We do that monitors a bill like they'll get pushed or get billed all of those things should show that in progress status part is very bottom line as long as we're a TTY it should show that status bar with everything else with like the estimated time to completion based on the last one and all that but only if it's on TTY, it's not a TTY then we'll just ignore that part but we need to follow the existing spec here
