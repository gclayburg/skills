 we need to add a extra status line on the top of the output for any kind of build monitoring command like a push or a belt command or status – F any of those monitoring commands we need to first output. One of the first lines needs to be an estimate estimate for the amount of time that we think this bill is gonna take this needs to be based on the the last successful build of this job, how long that took so if for example, we do a bill and find out that the last job for this the same project the last bill job that was successful took 5 1/2 minutes. I wanna print on the output of this build that just started print out how long we expect this bill to take to be. That way we can have an idea what to expect and also I'd like to do is yeah let us make another option where we can also specify extra context so the user can specify during any of these monitoring commands. They can specify something like – – old jobs not sure if that's right or not, but let's just all jobs equals the number, so – – old jobs equals five means that when we do a – – all jobs equals five we're gonna show also the top of the build very close to where the estimate is we're gonna show the last five bills that were done for this job. That way we get a little extra context but by default we're gonna show zero because it's gonna take extra API cause it's gonna be slower so let's just but default not show anything, but if the user does add a dash – all jobs equals the number it's gotta be a positive manager then we'll show that many jobs before so when you show this old job, we're just gonna show the one output show already you can find out what that looks like but just a one line output of the old job so I can see if it was successful or failed or whatever and again. The number has to be a positive integer. I guess there will be OK to zero basically means the default not gonna show anything for old jobs but negative is not negative number is not allowed any kind of text is not allowed, etc..
