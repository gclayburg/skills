 we need to be able to add a dash F option to status when we're using dash dash line the way it is right now we get an error if we try to use – – line and then – F cannot use – – line with – – follow, but we don't want that we want to be able to use a dash with dash dash lines what that means somebody does a dash F it means that we're gonna show the dash with a dash dash line we're gonna show one line of output for the build if one is a build is going on what it needs to show as a line that says in progress and it's gonna stay in progress until it's finished and we're gonna need to do an estimate estimate for how long the bill should take because we can look at the last build the last successful building and estimate that this bill should probably take about that long and when we were so we're showing in progress, we're gonna show that a bar graph that that pops up and displays on the screen a graph this shows how far along we are in the bill estimated course which can't really tell and it's gonna show in progress until it's finished when it's finished that's gonna change to be success or unstable or whatever else according to the cu so this bar graph showing in progress that's only gonna show up when a bill is actually going on if there's not any going on, it's not gonna show anything and when it's finished, it's gonna be erased and it's gonna go away and show the normal output that we're gonna see for a dash dash line this kind of output was only gonna work if we're actually on a TTY so check for that same kind of check I think we already do for showing colors and things like that if we're not on a TTY, then it's not gonna show anything until it's not gonna show anything for an in progress bill until the entire builders complete then we can show the success the unstable the failure lines are we do now so that's the option. We need that we don't have right now.
